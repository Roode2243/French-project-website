# Summary of Potential Issues in FrontEnd.html

1. **Missing JavaScript File**:
   - The file `script.js` is referenced in the HTML but is not present. This will cause any JavaScript functions (like `startQuiz()`) to fail.

2. **Links to Other HTML Files**:
   - Ensure that all linked HTML files (e.g., `conquest.html`, `hundred_years_war.html`, etc.) are present in the same directory. Missing files will lead to 404 errors when navigating.

3. **Console Errors**:
   - Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors or issues with loading resources. This can provide insights into what might be going wrong.

4. **HTML Structure**:
   - The overall structure of the HTML appears to be correct, but ensure that all tags are properly closed and that there are no syntax errors.

5. **Accessibility and SEO**:
   - Consider adding `alt` attributes to images (if any) and ensuring that the document is accessible.
