        <h1>La Conquête de la Gaule</h1>
        <p>Before Julius Caesar’s conquest, Gaul (modern-day France, Belgium, and parts of Switzerland and Germany) was a collection of tribal societies, loosely connected but often in conflict with one another. The Romans had already established control over the southern region (Provincia Narbonensis, or modern Provence) by the 120s BCE, but much of Gaul remained independent.  

In the mid-1st century BCE, Rome was undergoing significant internal turmoil. The Republic was marked by political rivalry, corruption, and social unrest. Julius Caesar, a rising political figure, saw military conquest as a way to gain power, wealth, and influence. His opportunity came in 58 BCE when the Helvetii, a Gallic tribe, attempted to migrate through Roman territory, giving Caesar a pretext to intervene. </p>
